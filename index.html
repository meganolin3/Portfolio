                            The Crimean War (1853-1856) transformed Istanbul, then the Ottoman capital, into a medical hub where new ideas were tested and exchanged among physicians and nurses from all over Europe to control the spread of infectious diseases and battle wounds. Patients were sent to the Ottoman capital for better treatment; specifically to a barrack style hospital founded as a unit of the Selimiye Barracks in Üsküdar. Known to the British as ‘Scutari’ with 3200-bed facility.

                            A violent storm on 14 November that was characterized by strong winds and torrential rain wrought havoc in the camps, severely damaged developing infrastructure and caused the loss of transport ships laden with vital stores. 
                            <br><br>
                            Several British ships were wrecked, including the steamship HMS ‘Prince’, which was carrying warm winter clothing and hay for the Commissariat’s horses. Altogether, 30 vessels with their precious cargoes of medical supplies, food and clothing were damaged. The troops in the trenches outside Sevastopol soon ran short of rations, winter clothes, tents, medical supplies and fuel for cooking. Poorly clothed, lacking shelter and succumbing to disease, by February 1855 the British force had been reduced to 12,000 effective men.

Cholera has broke out amongst the poor fellows who are exposed in the trenches day and night with nothing but their big coats to shelter them from the rain or cold... Water is very scarce and extremely muddy. I have not washed my face nor yet shaved since I landed here... This terrible Cholera... has made fearful ravages here.

That was not the end of my poor patients’ sufferings, for, from the scarcity of boats, it is not unlikely that many of them lay for several hours on the wharf before they could be put on board the ships that were to convey them to Scutari. The ships were often sailing ships, devoid of all convenience for the sick; the voyage was tedious and the mortality great, and it is well known that 10 percent of those embarked were thrown overboard before the vessels arrived at Scutari."

                            In November 1854, Florence Nightingale arrived in Scutari on the Black Sea. She arrived with a group of 38 nurses from England ready to help the British soldiers who were fighting in Crimea.

                            The hospital in a dreadful state, soldiers lay on the ground in the clothes in which they arrived. Many were malnourished and dehydrated because of water and food shortages. The wounded were mixed in with the infected and open latrines helped to spread infection.
                            <br><br>
                            Since the beginning of the Crimean War, newspapers had been printing horror stories about British army hospitals. As a response to such news, the British Parliament formed a commission to work on the improvement of hospitals serving British soldiers in the Ottoman Empire.

                            In 1855 an official Sanitary Commission arrived in Crimea and, with Nightingale's cooperation, they ensured that toilets and washing facilities were upgraded, ventilation was improved and overcrowding reduced. The mortality rate at the military hospitals went from 41% when Nightingale arrived to 2% by the end of the war.

                            "The tenacity of those at the front did much to rectify matters. Their perseverance resulted in improved health care and hospital accommodation, the development of harbour facilities and roads, the rationalisation of land transport, the construction of a railway network, and the deployment of a floating bakery and flour mill, steam-powered saw mill, steam distilling vessels, and a factory ship. Together these developments ensured that the necessaries for life were eventually brought to the camps on a regular basis. The health of the troops improved considerably from the spring of 1855 and by 1856 the health of the army was deemed to be very good by the standards of the day."

                            On the fall of 1855, the Allies attacked again. For a second time, the British failed to take the Redan. But the French capture of the Malakoff redoubt, another key part of the defences, led to the Russians abandoning Sevastopol.

                            The Allies spent another winter in the Crimea. This time it was the French Army’s turn to be decimated by disease, while the British with well-clothed, housed and equipped, were spared the sufferings of the previous winter. The British began to help the French with supplies, as the French had helped them the first year.

                            "Chenu (1870) made an even more devastating comparison, based on deaths during the two winters of the war. Remarkably, the French rates surged in the second year, even though hostilities ended in September. For the British Army, of course, the reductions in death rates began as soon as the sanitary reforms had been made, and they continued throughout the post-hostilities period, except for a new cholera epidemic."

                            The Russians were shaken by the loss of Sevastopol. In October 1855, their mainland base of Kinburn also fell to the Allies. When the Austrians threatened to enter the war against them, the Russians agreed to peace terms and the Treaty of Paris was signed in March 1856.
